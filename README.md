# Saudi Date Classification Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project integrates with my studies on supervised machine learning. The goal is to start with low-level models, such as decision trees, to determine whether a date is Ajwa or Medjool, and then eventually branch onto neural networks for image classification. The dataset is very small, so this project is primarily experimental rather than immediately applicable.

## Dataset
The dataset contains three subsets:  
1. **Hand-crafted features:** Numerical measurements of 20 date fruits to distinguish Ajwa and Medjool.  
2. **Images:** 200 images of the 20 dates for image-based classification.  
3. **Deep learning features:** Automatically generated numerical features from the images for ML classification.

## Hypothesis
Hand-crafted features of Saudi dates can be used to accurately classify Ajwa and Medjool types using basic supervised machine learning models.

## Methods
