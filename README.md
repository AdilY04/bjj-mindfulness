# Saudi Date Classification Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project integrates with my studies on supervised machine learning and is primarily experimental rather than immediately applicable (given the small sample size). The goal is to start with low-level models to determine whether a date is Ajwa or Medjool, and then eventually branch onto neural networks for image classification.

## Dataset
The dataset contains three subsets:  
1. **Hand-crafted features:** Numerical measurements of 20 date fruits to distinguish Ajwa and Medjool.  
2. **Images:** 200 images of the 20 dates for image-based classification.  
3. **Deep learning features:** Automatically generated numerical features from the images for ML classification.

## Hypothesis
Hand-crafted features of Saudi dates can be used to accurately classify Ajwa and Medjool types using basic supervised machine learning models.

## Methods
