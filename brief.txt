Project Brief (5-Day Scope)

Project Title: Law Firm Billing & Utilisation Analytics

Objective
The client has requested a focused analysis of lawyer productivity and billing efficiency. The goal is to:
Measure billable versus non-billable hours per lawyer, department, and seniority.
Assess utilisation rates across the firm.
Identify write-offs and unbilled hours to highlight revenue leakage.
Provide actionable insights on lawyer productivity and departmental performance.

This project emulates a real-world Big 4 analytics engagement, but scoped to a 5-day timeline for portfolio purposes.

Scope (5 Days)

Day 1 – Data Setup & Mock Dataset
Load the synthetic dataset into SQL (SQLite or PostgreSQL).
Write CREATE TABLE statements for Lawyers, Clients, Matters, Time Entries, and Invoices.
Validate data integrity and types.

Day 2 – ETL & Cleaning
Pull data from SQL into pandas.
Compute key metrics:
Total hours per lawyer
Billable vs non-billable hours
Utilisation rate
Revenue per lawyer/matter

Day 3 – Core Analysis
Aggregations by:
Lawyer
Department
Seniority
Client
Identify:
Write-offs and unpaid invoices
Top/bottom performing lawyers and departments

Day 4 – Visualisation & Insights
Create Matplotlib charts:
Bar charts: revenue by department
Line charts: billable hours over time
Pie charts: client revenue distribution
Heatmaps: utilisation by lawyer & month
Generate simple insights (e.g., “Top 10 clients contribute 60% of revenue”)

Day 5 – Final Deliverables & GitHub Prep
Compile a Jupyter notebook with explanations and charts.
Structure GitHub repo with clear folders, README, and CSVs/DB.
Optional: PDF summary of key metrics and visualisations.

Deliverables
SQL Database / CSVs: Clean tables for analysis.
Python ETL Notebook: Connects SQL → pandas, computes metrics.
Analysis Notebook: Aggregations, visualisations, and insights.
Visualisations: Static charts demonstrating utilisation, revenue, and write-offs.

GitHub Repo: Professional structure with README explaining methodology.

Outcome
At the end of 5 days, you will have a realistic, corporate-style analytics project that:
Demonstrates SQL & Python/pandas skills
Shows corporate-style reporting & visualisations
Provides insights similar to a Big 4 engagement
Is ready for GitHub portfolio or interview discussion
